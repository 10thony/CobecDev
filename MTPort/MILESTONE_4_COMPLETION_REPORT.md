# Milestone 4 Completion Report: AI Integration

## Overview
Milestone 4 focused on integrating advanced AI capabilities into the Microsoft Teams Widget, leveraging Azure Cognitive Services, OpenAI, and Google Gemini for vector search, embeddings, and skill extraction. This milestone ensures that the Teams app delivers fast, accurate, and context-aware search and data management experiences.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Azure Cognitive Services & AI Setup
- Provisioned Azure Cognitive Services (Text Analytics, Cognitive Search) and configured all required environment variables.
- Ensured all dependencies for AI integration are present in the Azure Functions package.

### 2. Enhanced AI Service Layer
- Updated `aiService.ts` to support:
  - Embedding generation (OpenAI, Gemini, Azure fallback)
  - Multi-embedding for jobs and resumes
  - Enhanced vector search with skill filtering and similarity
  - Sentiment analysis and skill extraction
- All AI logic is modular and ready for Teams integration.

### 3. Azure Functions for AI Endpoints
- Implemented HTTP-triggered Azure Functions in `aiManagement.ts`:
  - `/generateEmbeddings`
  - `/enhancedVectorSearch`
  - `/processDocument`
  - `/extractSkills`
  - `/analyzeSentiment`
  - `/searchAzureSearch`
  - `/batchProcessEmbeddings`
- Functions are fully integrated with the AI service layer and Cosmos DB.

### 4. Teams Frontend Integration
- Created/updated `src/services/teamsApi.ts` to call new Azure Functions endpoints.
- Updated Teams Vector Search component to use the new AI endpoints, display extracted skills, similarity scores, and allow filtering.
- Ensured all UI is built with Fluent UI and follows Teams design guidelines.

### 5. Testing & Validation
- Verified end-to-end flow: Teams UI → Azure Function → AI Service → Cosmos DB/Search → Teams UI.
- Used provided test scripts and manual testing to validate embedding generation, search accuracy, and skill extraction.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **API Rate Limiting**: Batched embedding requests and added delays to avoid hitting rate limits.
- **Teams Context Handling**: Provided fallback logic for Teams context and authentication in both local and Teams environments.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensured all AI-generated data (embeddings, skills) is stored and retrieved consistently from Cosmos DB.

---

## Next Steps
- Monitor AI performance and costs in production.
- Optimize similarity thresholds and caching as needed.
- Continue user testing and collect feedback for further improvements.

## Status
**Milestone 4: AI Integration is COMPLETE.**

All AI endpoints are live, integrated, and tested within the Teams Widget. The system is ready for the final milestone: Teams-specific features and adaptive cards.
