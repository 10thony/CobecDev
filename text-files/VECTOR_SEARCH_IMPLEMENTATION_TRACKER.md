# VECTOR SEARCH IMPLEMENTATION TRACKER

## Overview
This file tracks the implementation progress of the vector search features described in `VECTOR_SEARCH_IDEATION.md`. Each section corresponds to the numbered requirements in the ideation document.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Section 1: User Requirements - COMPLETED
- [x] User submits a vector search query
- [x] System returns job postings relevant to the query
- [x] System returns resumes relevant to the query
- [x] Results are ordered by relevance
- [x] Max 10 jobs and 10 resumes in the response

### ðŸ”„ Section 2: Open Questions / Decisions - IN PROGRESS
- [x] Embedding strategy: Precompute and store embeddings for jobs/resumes
- [x] Strictness: Using strict cross-matching (only show jobs with matching resumes and vice versa)
- [ ] UI/UX: Display jobs and resumes in order of relevance, highlight cross-matches with unique colors

### âœ… Section 3: Embedding Strategy Recommendations - COMPLETED
- [x] Jobs/Resumes: Precompute and store embeddings for all job postings and resumes
- [x] Query: Always generate a dynamic embedding for the user's query at search time
- [x] Implementation: Using OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 model

### âœ… Section 4: High-Level Solution Outline - COMPLETED
- [x] Generate embedding for user query
- [x] Vector search jobs and resumes separately using the query embedding (top 10 each)
- [x] Cross-match: Find jobs and resumes that are highly relevant to each other
- [x] Assign unique colors to each cross-matched group (up to 10)
- [x] Return results: jobs and resumes, ordered by relevance, with color highlights for cross-matches

### âœ… Section 5: UI/UX Notes - COMPLETED
- [x] Display jobs and resumes in two lists, ordered by relevance
- [x] Use up to 10 unique colors to highlight cross-matched groups
- [x] Show the number of matches for each job/resume
- [x] Allow clicking a job to see its matching resumes (and vice versa)

## Current Implementation Details

### Backend Functions Available

### Completed Features
- âœ… Cross-matching logic between jobs and resumes
- âœ… Color coding for cross-matched groups (up to 10 colors)
- âœ… Match count display for each job/resume
- âœ… Interactive job-resume relationship display
- âœ… Dual threshold system (query similarity + cross-match similarity)
- âœ… Strict filtering (only show items with cross-matches)

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Testing & Validation
1. Test cross-matching accuracy with various queries
2. Validate color coding system works correctly
3. Test performance with large datasets
4. Verify match counts are accurate

### Priority 2: Optimization & Enhancement
1. Optimize performance for large datasets
2. Add error handling for edge cases
3. Consider implementing pagination for large result sets
4. Add export functionality for cross-matched results

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
1. Add filtering by color groups
2. Implement detailed cross-match analysis view
3. Add batch operations for cross-matched groups
4. Consider adding machine learning improvements

## Technical Notes

### Current Data Structure
- **Jobs**: 181 documents with embeddings
- **Resumes**: 100 documents with embeddings
- **Embedding Model**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (1536 dimensions)
- **Similarity Metric**: Cosine similarity

### Performance Considerations
- Current implementation loads all documents into memory
- Cross-matching will require O(n*m) comparisons
- Consider implementing pagination for large datasets
- May need to optimize embedding storage and retrieval

## Last Updated
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Status**: All sections completed - Full cross-matching implementation with color coding
- **Next Milestone**: Testing and validation of cross-matching functionality
