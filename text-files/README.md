- **Job-Related Queries**: Get information about specific job postings or requirements
- **Resume Analysis**: Receive feedback on resume content and suggestions
- **Career Guidance**: Get advice on career paths, skills development, and job search strategies

## üîç Vector Search Functionality

### Advanced Semantic Matching
The vector search system uses AI-powered embeddings to understand the semantic meaning of job postings and resumes, enabling intelligent matching beyond simple keyword searches.

### Core Components

#### 1. **Text Preprocessing**
- Cleans and normalizes text from job postings and resumes
- Extracts key skills, requirements, and qualifications
- Creates searchable text combinations for optimal matching
- Handles various document formats (Excel, JSON, Word documents)

#### 2. **Embedding Generation**
- Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model
- Generates 1536-dimensional vectors for semantic understanding
- Stores embeddings in MongoDB for fast retrieval
- Supports batch processing for large datasets

#### 3. **Vector Search Engine**
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates semantic similarity between documents
- **Job-to-Resume Matching**: Find candidates for specific positions
- **Resume-to-Job Matching**: Discover relevant opportunities for job seekers
- **AI Agent Search**: Natural language query processing for complex searches

#### 4. **Data Management System**
- **Import Capabilities**: 
  - Excel files (.xlsx, .xls) for bulk job posting data
  - JSON files for structured resume data
  - Word documents (.docx) for individual resumes
- **Data Processing**: Automatic parsing and metadata extraction
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced filtering by location, skills, experience level
- **Export Functionality**: Download processed data for external use

### Search Features
- **Semantic Search**: Find matches based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Skill-Based Filtering**: Filter results by specific skills or requirements
- **Location Matching**: Geographic-based job and candidate matching
- **Experience Level Matching**: Align job requirements with candidate experience
- **Real-time Results**: Instant search results with similarity scores

### Use Cases

#### For Job Seekers
- Find relevant job postings based on skills and experience
- Discover career opportunities they might miss through traditional search
- Get personalized job recommendations with similarity scores
- Understand job requirements and qualifications

#### For Recruiters
- Find qualified candidates for specific positions
- Identify candidates with transferable skills
- Reduce time-to-hire with better matching algorithms
- Access detailed candidate profiles and experience

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- MongoDB database (local or Atlas)
- OpenAI API key for vector search functionality

### Environment Configuration
1. **Run the setup script** to configure API keys:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-env.js
   ```
   
   This creates a `.env` file with:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For server-side AI operations
   - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: For client-side vector search
   - `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: For authentication
   - `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`: For backend deployment

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

This starts both the frontend (Vite) and backend (Convex) servers simultaneously.

## üìä Data Management

### Importing Data
1. **Job Postings**: Use the Data Management page to import Excel files containing job listings
2. **Resumes**: Import individual Word documents or bulk JSON files
3. **Processing**: The system automatically extracts skills, requirements, and generates embeddings

### Vector Search Setup
1. **Generate Embeddings**: Run the embedding generator to create semantic vectors
2. **Test Search**: Use the Vector Search page to test matching functionality
3. **AI Agent**: Launch the conversational AI interface for natural language queries
