AJAI - System Architecture & Tech Stack Overview
üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture
AJAI is a full-stack AI-powered job matching and chat platform built with a modern, scalable architecture that combines real-time chat capabilities with advanced vector search technology. The application follows a client-server architecture with a serverless backend approach.
Architecture Pattern
Frontend: Single Page Application (SPA) with React
Backend: Serverless functions with Convex
Database: Real-time database with Convex + MongoDB integration
Authentication: Third-party auth provider (Clerk)
AI Services: Multi-provider AI integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
